# Decision Support Systems
 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques
The project aims to streamline the loan approval process by providing an automated decision support system. Through a Python GUI, users input parameters such as income, previous bank limit, number of cards, and balance to determine loan eligibility. The system utilizes Logistic Regression, chosen for its accuracy and efficiency, to classify applicants as "worthy" or "not worthy" based on credit risk prediction.
